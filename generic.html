            I have work 7 years for the Club
            Saint-Exupéry which is a non-profit association approved by the
            government as a social centre. Its actions are directed towards
            seniors, adults, teenagers and children.</p>
            
            <p>Corinne Monfort the director was my mentor, and a
            huge inspiration. She taught me how to manage teams wisely, with
            empathie and fairness. I will always remember what she told me when
            I first started to became a manager..<br/> <em>"A good manager doesn't give
            orders, she/he give advices, she/he lead and motivate. A good manager
            doesn't have to be bossy; her/his team will follow her/him because
            they will respect her/him and will trust her/him abilities. A good
            manager is someone that will care for her/his team and see the potential in each of her/his
            team member and will use it to lift her/him team up"</em></p>

      <h3 > Project « Citizen Council »</h3>
      <p>Lead a government project such as the "Citizens Council" set up in 2014 by the government (4 years project). This was a
      pilot project integrating a national mission. Citizen councils are, in France, independent structures of political
      power, with an objective, active and direct participation of all residents and neighbourhood actors, in the development
      and implementation of city contracts. Created advertising posters to recruit volunteers. I oversaw all the internal and
      external communication around this project. Created and lead the « Saint-Exupery citizen council » (Poissy 78). The
      deadlines for setting up this project were extremely short, but thanks to the volunteers, we did it on time. I waited
      for the completion of the project; "Independence of this citizen council and its recognition at the level of the city
      and the state"; before leaving my job and travelling.</p>
    
    
        <h3>Project « CLAS »</h3>
        <p>
        Defined, managed and followed budgets of the association's actions such as "CLAS Project" (Local Contract of
        Accompaniment to Schooling). I implemented this project at the request of the structure, in 2010/2011.I had full
        responsibility for the entire marketing part related to it. I sought and obtained new funding (Private investor,
        sponsorship, state and regional subsidy) to finance the different actions and services proposed, attached to this
        project.
